              "'\\ufeffTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\n\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\n\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\n\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\n\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\nthat you intended to go into harness.”\\n\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\nservant girl?”\\n\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\nhave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.”\\n\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\\n\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\nprocess of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.”\\n\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\ndown into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.”\\n\\n“Frequently.”\\n\\n“How often?”\\n\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\n\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\nupon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\n\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\\nsaid, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\nwear a mask.”\\n\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\\nmeans?”\\n\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\nit?”\\n\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\nwritten.\\n\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\nstiff.”\\n\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\\n\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\\nwith a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\\n\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\n\\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\\nwhich is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\\nour ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\\nfrom his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\\nGerman-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\nthat?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\nfrom his cigarette.\\n\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\n\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\\nall quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\ndoubts.”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\\nwhistled.\\n\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\\nthe window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\\nand fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\\nis nothing else.”\\n\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\n\\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\n\\n“But your client—”\\n\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\n\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\n\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\\nof obstinacy.\\n\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?”\\n\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\\nalone.”\\n\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.”\\n\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,\\n“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\nEuropean history.”\\n\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\n\\n“And I.”\\n\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\nnot exactly my own.”\\n\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\\n\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\\nkings of Bohemia.”\\n\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\\n\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\\nshould be better able to advise you.”\\n\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”\\nhe cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\n\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\nBohemia.”\\n\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”\\n\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\\nIrene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\nContralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!\\nRetired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your\\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\\nthose letters back.”\\n\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\n\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?”\\n\\n“There is the writing.”\\n\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\n\\n“My private note-paper.”\\n\\n“Stolen.”\\n\\n“My own seal.”\\n\\n“Imitated.”\\n\\n“My photograph.”\\n\\n“Bought.”\\n\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\n\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.”\\n\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\n\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”\\n\\n“It must be recovered.”\\n\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\n\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\n\\n“She will not sell.”\\n\\n“Stolen, then.”\\n\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.”\\n\\n“No sign of it?”\\n\\n“Absolutely none.”\\n\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\n\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.\\n\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\\n\\n“To ruin me.”\\n\\n“But how?”\\n\\n“I am about to be married.”\\n\\n“So I have heard.”\\n\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end.”\\n\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\\nlengths to which she would not go—none.”\\n\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n\\n“I am sure.”\\n\\n“And why?”\\n\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\n\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is\\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\npresent?”\\n\\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm.”\\n\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\n\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\n\\n“Then, as to money?”\\n\\n“You have _carte blanche_.”\\n\\n“Absolutely?”\\n\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\nhave that photograph.”\\n\\n“And for present expenses?”\\n\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\nit on the table.\\n\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\nto him.\\n\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\n\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\\n\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the\\nphotograph a cabinet?”\\n\\n“It was.”\\n\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like\\nto chat this little matter over with you.”\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\nshortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,\\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\\nI was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\\ncharacter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\n\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\\nfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\\ntimes before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\nheartily for some minutes.\\n\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.”\\n\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\\n\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\\nI left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the\\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest.\\n\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\\nlisten to.”\\n\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\n\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\\nbegan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\\nover my plan of campaign.\\n\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\\nHe was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\\nhis friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\\ntransferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\\nlikely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\\ncontinue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\ngentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\nto understand the situation.”\\n\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\n\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom\\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\\na man who was thoroughly at home.\\n\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to\\nthe cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\\nearnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &\\nHankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the\\nEdgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\\n\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t\\npulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\\na face that a man might die for.\\n\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.’\\n\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\\ncab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby\\nfare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.\\nMonica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\nminutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\n\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others\\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\n\\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\\n\\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\\n\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\\nthe secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\\nthat started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some\\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”\\n\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”\\n\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I\\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left\\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\\nwent off to make my own arrangements.”\\n\\n“Which are?”\\n\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I\\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\\nthis evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”\\n\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\n\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\n\\n“Not in the least.”\\n\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\n\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\n\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\n\\n“Then I am your man.”\\n\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\n\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\n\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\nlandlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”\\n\\n“And what then?”\\n\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\\ncome what may. You understand?”\\n\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\n\\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\\nquite follow me?”\\n\\n“Entirely.”\\n\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\nroll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted\\nwith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\nmyself clear?”\\n\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\\nthe signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\\nto wait you at the corner of the street.”\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\nfor the new role I have to play.”\\n\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\\nspecialist in crime.\\n\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\\nSherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\\nless private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\\nquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\\nshabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\\n\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\nhouse, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\\nthe photograph?”\\n\\n“Where, indeed?”\\n\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\\nshe does not carry it about with her.”\\n\\n“Where, then?”\\n\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\\nto do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\\nindirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\\nin her own house.”\\n\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\n\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\n\\n“But how will you look?”\\n\\n“I will not look.”\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\n\\n“But she will refuse.”\\n\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\n\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\n\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\\n\\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\\n\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\\nbefore you can get him to hospital.”\\n\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\\npurse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\\nrough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\\n\\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\\n\\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\nThis way, please!”\\n\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\\nthe window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\\nso that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\\nwhether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\\nwas playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\\nthe injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\\nto draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\\nmy heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\\nthought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\\ninjuring another.\\n\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\\nrocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out\\nof my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\nill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\\n“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\\nopen window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\\nthe voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\\nand in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\\nquiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\\n\\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\\nbetter. It is all right.”\\n\\n“You have the photograph?”\\n\\n“I know where it is.”\\n\\n“And how did you find out?”\\n\\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\\n\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\n\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\n\\n“I guessed as much.”\\n\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\n\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\n\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\\nsee which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\\n\\n“How did that help you?”\\n\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\\nshe half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\\n\\n“And now?” I asked.\\n\\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\\na satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\\n\\n“And when will you call?”\\n\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\\ndelay.”\\n\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\n\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\\nstreet. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the\\nroom.\\n\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\\nshoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\\n“Not yet.”\\n\\n“But you have hopes?”\\n\\n“I have hopes.”\\n\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”\\n\\n“We must have a cab.”\\n\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\n\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once\\nmore for Briony Lodge.\\n\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\n\\n“Married! When?”\\n\\n“Yesterday.”\\n\\n“But to whom?”\\n\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\n\\n“But she could not love him.”\\n\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\n\\n“And why in hopes?”\\n\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\\nyour Majesty’s plan.”\\n\\n“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\\nWhat a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,\\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\n\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\n\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\\nthis morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for\\nthe Continent.”\\n\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\nsurprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”\\n\\n“Never to return.”\\n\\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”\\n\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\\nsuperscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My\\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n\\n    “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\\n    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\n    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\\n    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\\n    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\\n    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\n    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\\n    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\\n    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\\n    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\\n    down just as you departed.\\n\\n    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\\n    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\\n    the Temple to see my husband.\\n\\n    “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\\n    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\\n    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do\\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\\n    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\n    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\\n    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n\\n\\n    “Very truly yours,\\n\\n    “IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.”\\n\\n\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had\\nall three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity\\nthat she was not on my level?”\\n\\n“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that\\nI have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more\\nsuccessful conclusion.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\\nsafe as if it were in the fire.”\\n\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\n\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\\n“You have but to name it.”\\n\\n“This photograph!”\\n\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”\\n\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\\nI have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and,\\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\n\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\\nwoman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable\\ntitle of _the_ woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nII. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\n\\n\\n I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\\n autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\\n stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an\\n apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled\\n me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\n\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he\\nsaid cordially.\\n\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\n\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\n\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\n\\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\\n\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\n\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting\\nhis fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I\\nknow, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\\nso many of my own little adventures.”\\n\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I\\nobserved.\\n\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\\nitself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\nimagination.”\\n\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\\n\\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for\\notherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your\\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.\\nJabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\\nwhich I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that\\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\\nAs far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the\\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\\nyour narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has\\nnot heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the\\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As\\na rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of\\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\\ncases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”\\n\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\nlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\\npocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,\\nwith his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,\\nI took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my\\ncompanion, to read the indications which might be presented by his\\ndress or appearance.\\n\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\\nevery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\\npompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers,\\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\\nmetal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\\nAltogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\\ndiscontent upon his features.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,\\nthat he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done\\na considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\n\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?”\\nhe asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.\\nIt’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\\n\\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\\ndeveloped.”\\n\\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\\n\\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.”\\n\\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\\n\\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\\nrest it upon the desk?”\\n\\n“Well, but China?”\\n\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\ncould only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo\\nmarks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That\\ntrick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite\\npeculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought\\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\\nnothing in it after all.”\\n\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in\\nexplaining. ‘_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,’ you know, and my poor\\nlittle reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so\\ncandid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted\\nhalfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all. You\\njust read it for yourself, sir.”\\n\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\\n\\n“TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late\\nEzekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another\\nvacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £ 4 a\\nweek for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in\\nbody and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.\\nApply in person on Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the\\noffices of the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.”\\n\\n\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\n\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\\nhigh spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he.\\n“And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about\\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper\\nand the date.”\\n\\n“It is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”\\n\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\n\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s\\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair,\\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I\\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\\nwould have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half\\nwages so as to learn the business.”\\n\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s\\nhard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;\\nand I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I\\nam able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I\\nput ideas in his head?”\\n\\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes\\nunder the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\nemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as\\nremarkable as your advertisement.”\\n\\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow\\nfor photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\\ninto its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on\\nthe whole he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”\\n\\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking\\nand keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a\\nwidower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three\\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do\\nnothing more.\\n\\n“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\\npaper in his hand, and he says:\\n\\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\\n\\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\\n\\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the\\nRed-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\nit, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\\nso that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.\\nIf my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all\\nready for me to step into.’\\n\\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to\\ngo to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\ndoor-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,\\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\\n\\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked\\nwith his eyes open.\\n\\n“‘Never.’\\n\\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\nvacancies.’\\n\\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\\nneed not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\\n\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\nbusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\n\\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\n\\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for\\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where\\nyou should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League\\nwas founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very\\npeculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great\\nsympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he\\nhad left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\nmen whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay\\nand very little to do.’\\n\\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\napply.’\\n\\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;\\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\n\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if\\nthere was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance\\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so\\nmuch about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\\nhim to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.\\nHe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and\\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\n\\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\\nStreet was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a\\ncoster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in\\nthe whole country as were brought together by that single\\nadvertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange,\\nbrick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\\nmany were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding\\nwould not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed\\nand pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\\nto the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon\\nthe stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\\nwedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”\\n\\n“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as\\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\n“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\n\\n“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even\\nredder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,\\nand then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\ndisqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\\nmatter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much\\nmore favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\n\\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to\\nfill a vacancy in the League.’\\n\\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every\\nrequirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He\\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\\nuntil I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n\\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am\\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized\\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\\n‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive\\nthat all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have\\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales\\nof cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped\\nover to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\\nthe vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n\\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a\\nmarried man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\\n\\n“I answered that I had not.\\n\\n“His face fell immediately.\\n\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\\nto hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and\\nspread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\n\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not\\nto have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few\\nminutes he said that it would be all right.\\n\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but\\nwe must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as\\nyours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\n\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\\n\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I\\nshould be able to look after that for you.’\\n\\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\n\\n“‘Ten to two.’\\n\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\\nBesides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\\nto anything that turned up.\\n\\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\\n\\n“‘Is £ 4 a week.’\\n\\n“‘And the work?’\\n\\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\\n\\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\n\\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\\nwhole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The\\nwill is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the\\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\\n\\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said\\nI.\\n\\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your\\nbillet.’\\n\\n“‘And the work?’\\n\\n“‘Is to copy out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. There is the first\\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\\nto-morrow?’\\n\\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\\n\\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\ngain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\nfortune.\\n\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\\nspirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair\\nmust be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I\\ncould not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could\\nmake such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything\\nso simple as copying out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. Vincent\\nSpaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had\\nreasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I\\ndetermined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of\\nink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\nstarted off for Pope’s Court.\\n\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to\\nsee that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and\\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\\nwas right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\\nupon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office\\nafter me.\\n\\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It\\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I\\nwas there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.\\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a\\ntime, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to\\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would\\nnot risk the loss of it.\\n\\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with\\ndiligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me\\nsomething in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my\\nwritings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\n\\n“To an end?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual\\nat ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\\nof cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here\\nit is, and you can read for yourself.”\\n\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of\\nnote-paper. It read in this fashion:\\n\\n“THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\\nof laughter.\\n\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”\\n\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\nhad half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is\\nmost refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying\\nso, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you\\ntake when you found the card upon the door?”\\n\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the\\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\nground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\nthe Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\\nbody. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the\\nname was new to him.\\n\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\\n\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\n\\n“‘Yes.’\\n\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and\\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\\nwere ready. He moved out yesterday.’\\n\\n“‘Where could I find him?’\\n\\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King\\nEdward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\\n\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\\neither Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\n\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that\\nif I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,\\nMr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\\nas I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\\nwho were in need of it, I came right away to you.”\\n\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\nit than might at first sight appear.”\\n\\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a\\nweek.”\\n\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not\\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say\\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\\nwhich comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\\n\\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\ntheir object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It\\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\npounds.”\\n\\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one\\nor two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called\\nyour attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\\n\\n“About a month then.”\\n\\n“How did he come?”\\n\\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\\n\\n“Was he the only applicant?”\\n\\n“No, I had a dozen.”\\n\\n“Why did you pick him?”\\n\\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\\n\\n“At half wages, in fact.”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\\n\\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\nthough he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\nforehead.”\\n\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as\\nmuch,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\\nearrings?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\\nlad.”\\n\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\n\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\\n\\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a\\nmorning.”\\n\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I\\nhope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”\\n\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you\\nmake of it all?”\\n\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious\\nbusiness.”\\n\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less\\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\\ndifficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\\n\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\n\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg\\nthat you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in\\nhis chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\\nhe had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\\nsprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\\nmind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\n\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked.\\n“What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\\nhours?”\\n\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\\n\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and\\nwe can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\\nof German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\\nalong!”\\n\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\\nclumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\\nand uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\\n“JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\\nplace where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock\\nHolmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\\nall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he\\nwalked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\\nlooking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,\\nand, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\\nthree times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly\\nopened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\\nstep in.\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go\\nfrom here to the Strand.”\\n\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing\\nthe door.\\n\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\\nbefore.”\\n\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in\\nthis mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your\\nway merely in order that you might see him.”\\n\\n“Not him.”\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\n\\n“And what did you see?”\\n\\n“What I expected to see.”\\n\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\n\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\nspies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\nLet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\n\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\\nthe retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as\\nthe front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\narteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\\na double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\\nthe hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we\\nlooked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\\nthey really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\\nsquare which we had just quitted.\\n\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\\nthe line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\\nIt is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\nMortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\\nbranch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\\nMcFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\\nother block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had\\nsome play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”\\n\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\nof Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\\nextreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\\nthe reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\\nmortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\\nJames’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\n\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\\n\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\n\\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.”\\n\\n“Why serious?”\\n\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday\\nrather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\n\\n“At what time?”\\n\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\n\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\n\\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand,\\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\n\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\\nonly what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my\\nhouse in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\\nof the red-headed copier of the _Encyclopædia_ down to the visit to\\nSaxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\\nme. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a\\nman who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\\nup in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\\nexplanation.\\n\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\nhansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard\\nthe sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in\\nanimated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\\nJones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\\nsad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\\nfrock-coat.\\n\\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you\\nknow Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\\n\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his\\nconsequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\nchase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\\n\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n\\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the\\npolice agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he\\nwon’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say\\nthat once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the\\nAgra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\\nforce.”\\n\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with\\ndeference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first\\nSaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\\nrubber.”\\n\\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for\\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\\nsome £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\\nwish to lay your hands.”\\n\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,\\nMr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a\\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\\nand he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\nknow where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\nI’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\\n\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve\\nhad one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\\nand quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\\nWatson and I will follow in the second.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\\nlay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\nafternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\nuntil we emerged into Farrington Street.\\n\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\\nit as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\\nis as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\\nclaws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\n\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\nguidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\\nat another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\n\\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up\\nthe lantern and gazed about him.\\n\\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\nflags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he\\nremarked, looking up in surprise.\\n\\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes\\nseverely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\\n\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\\nthe floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\\nminutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to\\nsatisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\\npocket.\\n\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly\\ntake any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\\ntime they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no\\ndoubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\\nprincipal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\\nand he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\\ncriminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\\nat present.”\\n\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\n\\n“Your French gold?”\\n\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It\\nhas become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\\nand that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit\\ncontains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\\nsubject.”\\n\\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\\nwill come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\\nscreen over that dark lantern.”\\n\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\n\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\nthought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber\\nafter all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far\\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\\nchoose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\\nthose. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\\nfire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\\n\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\\nand left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never\\nbefore experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\\nthe light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To\\nme, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\\nsomething depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\\ndank air of the vault.\\n\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through\\nthe house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\nasked you, Jones?”\\n\\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\n\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\nwait.”\\n\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\\nstiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\\nto the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\\nthin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\\nover the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\\nthe glint of a light.\\n\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\\nof light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\\nprotruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\\nmarked a chink between the stones.\\n\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\\nlantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\\nrested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\\nhole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags?\\nGreat Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\nThe other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\\nas Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\\nrevolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and\\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\n\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at\\nall.”\\n\\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that\\nmy pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\\n\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\\n\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\ncompliment you.”\\n\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\\neffective.”\\n\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at\\nclimbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\\n\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be\\naware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\\nwhen you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\\n\\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you\\nplease, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\nHighness to the police-station?”\\n\\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\\nthe three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\\nthe cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\nthat have ever come within my experience.”\\n\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\\nClay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this\\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\n\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\\nsat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly\\nobvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\\nof the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\\nout of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of\\nmanaging it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\\nThe method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the\\ncolour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must\\ndraw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They\\nput in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\\nrogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\\nsecure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I\\nheard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\\nthat he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\\n\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\\n\\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\\nvulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s\\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\\nas they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\\ncould it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and\\nhis trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end\\nof this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\nassistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\\ndaring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\\ncellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.\\n\\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It\\nwas not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant\\nanswered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\\nupon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were\\nwhat I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\\nwrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\\nburrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\\nwalked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our\\nfriend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\\ndrove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the\\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\\n\\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I\\nasked.\\n\\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that\\nthey had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should\\nuse it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\\nremoved. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\\nwould give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I\\nexpected them to come to-night.”\\n\\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.\\n“It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\n\\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel\\nit closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\\nfrom the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\\nso.”\\n\\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\nlittle use,” he remarked. “‘_L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout_,’\\nas Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. A CASE OF IDENTITY\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the\\nfire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than\\nanything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to\\nconceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If\\nwe could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great\\ncity, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which\\nare going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the\\ncross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\\nand unprofitable.”\\n\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come\\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\\nWe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\nartistic.”\\n\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\nrealistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police\\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\\nvital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so\\nunnatural as the commonplace.”\\n\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,”\\nI said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\\nhere”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a\\npractical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A\\nhusband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I\\nknow without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There\\nis, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers\\ncould invent nothing more crude.”\\n\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said\\nHolmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the\\nDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing\\nup some small points in connection with it. The husband was a\\nteetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\\nthat he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\\nout his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\\nallow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\\naverage story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge\\nthat I have scored over you in your example.”\\n\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\\ncentre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely\\nways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is\\na little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance\\nin the case of the Irene Adler papers.”\\n\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\n\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which\\nI served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to\\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\\nproblems.”\\n\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.\\n\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\nThey are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,\\nI have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a\\nfield for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are\\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a\\nrule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that\\nI may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\n\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over\\nhis shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large\\nwoman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\\nfeather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\\nof Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she\\npeeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\\nbody oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\\nglove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\\nthe bell.\\n\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his\\ncigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an\\n_affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\\nmatter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\\ndiscriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\\nresolve our doubts.”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\\npilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\\nwhich he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\\nan armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted\\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little\\ntrying to do so much typewriting?”\\n\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are\\nwithout looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\\nwords, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve heard about\\nme, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\nshould you come to consult me?”\\n\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up\\nfor dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not\\nrich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the\\nlittle that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what\\nhas become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\n\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\nSutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made\\nme angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my\\nfather—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go\\nto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\\nthere was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things\\nand came right away to you.”\\n\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is\\ndifferent.”\\n\\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.”\\n\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,\\nwhen she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was\\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\\nmother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\\ntraveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\\nwhich wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been\\nalive.”\\n\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\\nthe greatest concentration of attention.\\n\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\nAuckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand\\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\\n\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large\\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that\\na single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\\n\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\\nthat as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and\\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\\ncourse, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\\nevery quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\\npretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a\\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\n\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is\\nmy friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\nmyself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel.”\\n\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at\\nthe fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,”\\nshe said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank\\ndid not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But\\nthis time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to\\nprevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\nfather’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit\\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\\nout of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to\\nFrance upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with\\nMr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.”\\n\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\nwoman, for she would have her way.”\\n\\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr.\\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\nagain, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\\n\\n“No?”\\n\\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t\\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\\nshould be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\\nmine yet.”\\n\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\\n\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\\nhe had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every\\nday. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for\\nfather to know.”\\n\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we\\ntook. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\nStreet—and—”\\n\\n“What office?”\\n\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\\n\\n“Where did he live, then?”\\n\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\n\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\n\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\n\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\n\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\\ntypewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said\\nthat when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were\\ntypewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That\\nwill just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little\\nthings that he would think of.”\\n\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of\\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\nconspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\\ngentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\nwhispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\\nglasses against the glare.”\\n\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned\\nto France?”\\n\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\\nalways be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\\nand that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour\\nfrom the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they\\ntalked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but\\nthey both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\\ndidn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask\\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want\\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\\nvery morning of the wedding.”\\n\\n“It missed him, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\\n\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\nFriday. Was it to be in church?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s\\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\\nput us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\\nlooked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\\n\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said\\nHolmes.\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;\\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I\\nwas always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would\\nclaim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a\\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\\n\\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\\n\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\\n\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\\nagain.”\\n\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\n\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could\\nanyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\\nme? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\\nvery independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\\nmine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\\nOh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at\\nnight.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to\\nsob heavily into it.\\n\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising, “and I\\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight\\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\\nfurther. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your\\nmemory, as he has done from your life.”\\n\\n“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”\\n\\n“I fear not.”\\n\\n“Then what has happened to him?”\\n\\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\n\\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s _Chronicle_,” said she. “Here\\nis the slip and here are four letters from him.”\\n\\n“Thank you. And your address?”\\n\\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\\n\\n“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\nfather’s place of business?”\\n\\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\nFenchurch Street.”\\n\\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave\\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let\\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\\nlife.”\\n\\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true\\nto Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\n\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\\nShe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,\\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still\\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\\ndirected upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old\\nand oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit\\nit, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\n\\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her\\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\\na trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\nAndover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\\nwere new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\\n\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\nme,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\\nand so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\\nrealise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\\ngather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”\\n\\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\\nfeather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn\\nupon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was\\nbrown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at\\nthe neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at\\nthe right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round,\\nhanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in\\na vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n\\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\nhave a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my\\nboy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always\\nat a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the\\nknee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her\\nsleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double\\nline a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against\\nthe table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\\nof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\\nbroadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark\\nupon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\\n\\n“It surprised me.”\\n\\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested\\non glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was\\nwearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one\\nhaving a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was\\nbuttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at\\nthe first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,\\notherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\\nhurry.”\\n\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\n\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\\nbut after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\\nand finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and\\ndipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark\\nwould not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though\\nrather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you\\nmind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\n\\nI held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said, “on\\nthe morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\\nfive ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black\\nhair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and\\nmoustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,\\nwhen last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,\\ngold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters\\nover elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in\\nLeadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,” &c, &c.\\n\\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued,\\nglancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in\\nthem to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\\n\\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\\n\\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat\\nlittle ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\\npoint about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it\\nconclusive.”\\n\\n“Of what?”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\\nupon the case?”\\n\\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to\\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\n\\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to\\nthe young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could\\nmeet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that\\nwe should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can\\ndo nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our\\nlittle problem upon the shelf for the interim.”\\n\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must\\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\\nhe treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\\nfathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of\\nBohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to\\nthe weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary\\ncircumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would\\nbe a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\n\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\\nhe held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity\\nof the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\n\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\\nthe time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\\nsufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself\\nfree and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\\nhalf afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of\\nthe little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\narmchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.\\n\\n“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”\\n\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\n\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\\nof the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\\n\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\nSutherland?”\\n\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a\\ntap at the door.\\n\\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He\\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\\n\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\\nyears of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,\\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\\ngrey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\\ntop-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\\nnearest chair.\\n\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this\\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\nme for six o’clock?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\\nown master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you\\nabout this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\\nlinen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she\\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind\\non a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe\\nthat I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\n\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am\\ndelighted to hear it,” he said.\\n\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really\\nquite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are\\nquite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in\\nthis note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some\\nlittle slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the\\n‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\nobvious.”\\n\\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\ndoubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\\n\\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\nWindibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to\\ncrime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I\\nhave here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They\\nare all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and\\nthe ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I\\nhave alluded are there as well.”\\n\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If\\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\nit.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\ndoor. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”\\n\\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n\\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,\\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\\nfor me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us\\ntalk it over.”\\n\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter\\nof moisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\\n\\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\\nway as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of\\nevents, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.”\\n\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on\\nthe corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his\\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n\\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,”\\nsaid he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\\nas she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their\\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it\\nwas evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little\\nincome, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her\\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\\ndoes her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\\nkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of\\nher own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She\\nbecame restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\\npositive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\nstepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\\nthe face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\\ngirl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other\\nlovers by making love himself.”\\n\\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought\\nthat she would have been so carried away.”\\n\\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\\ndecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her\\nstepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an\\ninstant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s\\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\\nadmiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\\nreal effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\\nengagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from\\nturning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\\nyoung lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\\nfor some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\\nTestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\\nto another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I\\nthink that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”\\n\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\\npale face.\\n\\n“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so\\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\\nbreaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from\\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”\\n\\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and\\nthrowing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved\\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\\nto lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not\\npart of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I\\nthink I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the\\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\\ncould see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\\nroad.\\n\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\nhimself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from\\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\n\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I\\nremarked.\\n\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer\\nAngel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as\\nfar as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men\\nwere never together, but that the one always appeared when the other\\nwas away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious\\nvoice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My\\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his\\nsignature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so\\nfamiliar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of\\nit. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\\nall pointed in the same direction.”\\n\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\n\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew\\nthe firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\\ndescription. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result\\nof a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to\\nthe firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered\\nto the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed\\nthe peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at\\nhis business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,\\nhis reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but\\ncharacteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.\\n_Voilà tout_!”\\n\\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\\n\\n“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\\nPersian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and\\ndanger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as\\nmuch sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\\n\\n\\n\\n IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\\n\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\n\\n“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the\\nwest of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be\\nglad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave\\nPaddington by the 11:15.”\\n\\n“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you\\ngo?”\\n\\n“I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\\npresent.”\\n\\n“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you\\nare always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ cases.”\\n\\n“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\\nof them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I\\nhave only half an hour.”\\n\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect\\nof making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and\\nsimple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my\\nvalise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing\\nup and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and\\ntaller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n\\n“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a\\nconsiderable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\\nIf you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\\n\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers\\nwhich Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,\\nwith intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past\\nReading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and\\ntossed them up onto the rack.\\n\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\\n\\n“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”\\n\\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been\\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple\\ncases which are so extremely difficult.”\\n\\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\\n\\n“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue.\\nThe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it\\nis to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a\\nvery serious case against the son of the murdered man.”\\n\\n“It is a murder, then?”\\n\\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted\\nuntil I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will\\nexplain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to\\nunderstand it, in a very few words.\\n\\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was\\nlet to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\\npossible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as\\nthey were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,\\nand Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them\\nhad wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the\\nneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though\\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the\\nrace-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man\\nand a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\\nleast. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\\n\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe\\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream\\nwhich runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his\\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he\\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\n\\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a\\nfew minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the\\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\\nthe son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he\\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\n\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl\\nof fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\\nthe Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\\nand close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared\\nto be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using\\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\\nhand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home\\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said\\nthe words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\\nof the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\\nfresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\\nupon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which\\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\\nof ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\\nwas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\nreferred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the\\ncase as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”\\n\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\n\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\\nthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in\\nan equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It\\nmust be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\\nculprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and\\namong them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who\\nbelieve in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may\\nrecollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case\\nin his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case\\nto me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\\nwestward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\\nbreakfasts at home.”\\n\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will\\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case.”\\n\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\\nlaughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\\nemploying, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,\\nI very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\\nright-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\\n\\n“How on earth—”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you\\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\\nas we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\\nslovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\\nthat that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine\\na man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being\\nsatisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of\\nobservation and inference. Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just\\npossible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies\\nbefore us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering.”\\n\\n“What are they?”\\n\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing\\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of\\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\\nhave remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\\n\\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\\n\\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\\n\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\\na most suspicious remark.”\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can\\nat present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could\\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\\na scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\\nand firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\nhis hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which\\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\\nmind rather than of a guilty one.”\\n\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”\\nI remarked.\\n\\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\n\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\n\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find\\nit here, and may read it for yourself.”\\n\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\\nand having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which\\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\\noccurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read\\nit very carefully. It ran in this way:\\n\\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,\\nthe 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\\nCobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\\nwas going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the\\nBoscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which\\nis upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\\nthinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in\\nfront of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of\\n“Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then\\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be\\nmuch surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was\\ndoing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost\\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that\\nhis passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards\\nHatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I\\nheard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I\\nfound my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\\ninjured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\\ninstantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made\\nmy way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to\\nask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I\\nhave no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,\\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far\\nas I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’\\n\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion\\nto a rat.\\n\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n\\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was\\ndelirious.\\n\\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had\\nthis final quarrel?\\n\\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\\n\\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\n\\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n\\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably\\nin any future proceedings which may arise.\\n\\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\\n\\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal\\nbetween you and your father?\\n\\n“Witness: It was.\\n\\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,\\nand before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n\\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\n\\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\nreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n\\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\\n\\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\\n\\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the\\nleft of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of\\nsome sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked\\nround for it, but it was gone.\\n\\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\\n\\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\\n\\n“  ‘You cannot say what it was?’\\n\\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\\n\\n“‘How far from the body?’\\n\\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\\n\\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\\n\\n“‘About the same.’\\n\\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\\nit?’\\n\\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\\n\\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\\n\\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his\\nconcluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls\\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\\nfather’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against\\nthe son.”\\n\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the\\ncushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”\\nsaid he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s\\nfavour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\\ntoo much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent\\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too\\nmuch, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so\\n_outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\\nvanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of\\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\\nthat hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of\\naction. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\\nminutes.”\\n\\nIt was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the\\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found\\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,\\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\\nplatform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no\\ndifficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove\\nto the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\\n\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.\\n“I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.”\\n\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\n\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\\n\\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the\\nsofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do\\nnot think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\\n\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,\\nof course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\\nShe has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly\\ntold her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not\\nalready done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\n\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of\\nher natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of\\nus, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my\\ncompanion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell\\nyou so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\\nthat point. We have known each other since we were little children, and\\nI know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to\\nhurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\\n\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may\\nrely upon my doing all that I can.”\\n\\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do\\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he\\nis innocent?”\\n\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\n\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly\\nat Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has\\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\\n\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in\\nit.”\\n\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\\nbe a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as\\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little\\nof life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\\nlike that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\nthem.”\\n\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”\\n\\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of\\nit.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one\\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.\\n\\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I\\ncall to-morrow?”\\n\\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\\n\\n“The doctor?”\\n\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,\\nand Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is\\nshattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\\nold days in Victoria.”\\n\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\n\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\n\\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made\\nhis money.”\\n\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\\n\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go\\nto the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that\\nI know him to be innocent.”\\n\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\n\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I\\nleave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried\\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\n\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a few\\nminutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\\n\\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes.\\n“Have you an order to see him in prison?”\\n\\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”'"

              "' to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the veil from men s motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high power lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the home centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion one night it was on the twentieth of march 1888 i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the well remembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drug created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you seven i answered indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness then how do you know i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i can t imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room frequently how often well some hundreds of times then how many are there how many i don t know quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pink tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud the note was undated and without either signature or address there will call upon you to night at a quarter to eight o clock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companion s processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff peculiar that is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper what do you make of that asked holmes the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitz here we are egria it is in a german speaking country in bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette the paper was made in bohemia i said precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence this account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece there s money in this case watson if there is nothing else i think that i had better go holmes not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it but your client never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap come in said holmes a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double breasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history i promise said holmes and i you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own i was aware of it said holmes dryly the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of cassel felstein and hereditary king of bohemia but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the well known adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year 1858 contralto hum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsaw yes retired from operatic stage ha living in london quite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back precisely so but how was there a secret marriage none no legal papers or certificates none then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity there is the writing pooh pooh forgery my private note paper stolen my own seal imitated my photograph bought we were both in the photograph oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion i was mad insane you have compromised yourself seriously i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now it must be recovered we have tried and failed your majesty must pay it must be bought she will not sell stolen then five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result no sign of it absolutely none holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph to ruin me but how i am about to be married so i have heard to clotilde lothman von saxe meningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end and irene adler threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go none you are sure that she has not sent it yet i am sure and why because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress pray do so i shall be all anxiety then as to money you have carte blanche absolutely i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph and for present expenses the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note book and handed it to him and mademoiselle s address he asked is briony lodge serpentine avenue st john s wood holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet it was then good night your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and good night watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three o clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you ii at three o clock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o clock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunken looking groom ill kempt and side whiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friend s amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair what is it it s quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing i can t imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight o clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sitting room on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach house i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to and what of irene adler i asked oh she has turned all the men s heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentine mews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine mews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentleman s chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation i am following you closely i answered i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustached evidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross hankey s in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only half buttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadn t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twenty five minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind my cabby drove fast i don t think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me thank god he cried you ll do come come what then i asked come man come only three minutes or it won t be legal i was half dragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements which are some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your co operation i shall be delighted you don t mind breaking the law not in the least nor running a chance of arrest not in a good cause oh the cause is excellent then i am your man i was sure that i might rely on you but what is it you wish when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her and what then you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand i am to be neutral to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window yes you are to watch me for i will be visible to you yes and when i raise my hand so you will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me entirely it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumber s smoke rocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street precisely then you may entirely rely on me that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple minded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissors grinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl and several well dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a double edged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph where indeed it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a woman s dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her where then her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house but it has twice been burgled pshaw they did not know how to look but how will you look i will not look what then i will get her to show me but she will refuse she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissors grinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked he is dead cried several voices no no there s life in him shouted another but he ll be gone before you can get him to hospital he s a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the lady s purse and watch if it hadn t been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah he s breathing now he can t lie in the street may we bring him in marm surely bring him into the sitting room there is a comfortable sofa this way please slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and ill gentlemen ostlers and servant maids joined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend s arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right you have the photograph i know where it is and how did you find out she showed me as i told you she would i am still in the dark i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening i guessed as much then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick that also i could fathom then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sitting room which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance how did that help you it was all important when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box now it was clear to me that our lady of to day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little over precipitance may ruin all and now i asked our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king to morrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands and when will you call at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said good night mister sherlock holmes there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by i ve heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been iii i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face not yet but you have hopes i have hopes then come i am all impatience to be gone we must have a cab no my brougham is waiting then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge irene adler is married remarked holmes married when yesterday but to whom to an english lawyer named norton but she could not love him i am in hopes that she does and why in hopes because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty s plan it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham mr sherlock holmes i believe said she i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the 5 15 train from charing cross for the continent what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england never to return and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bell pull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way my dear mr sherlock holmes you really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down just as you departed well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you good night and started for the temple to see my husband we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call to morrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes very truly yours irene norton n e adler what a woman oh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty s business to a more successful conclusion on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire i am glad to hear your majesty say so i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes you have but to name it this photograph the king stared at him in amazement irene s photograph he cried certainly if you wish it i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman s wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman ii the red headed league i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout florid faced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially i was afraid that you were engaged so i am very much so then i can wait in the next room not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat encircled eyes try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherd s check trousers a not over clean black frock coat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion how in the name of good fortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour it s as true as gospel for i began as a ship s carpenter your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed well the snuff then and the freemasonry i won t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arc and compass breastpin ah of course i forgot that but the writing what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk well but china the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch chain the matter becomes even more simple mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir i took the paper from him and read as follows to the red headed league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of 4 a week for purely nominal services all red headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty one years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven o clock to duncan ross at the offices of the league 7 pope s court fleet street what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isn t it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date it is the morning chronicle of april 27 1890 just two months ago very good now mr wilson well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbroker s business at coburg square near the city it s not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes his name is vincent spaulding and he s not such a youth either it s hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i don t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole he s a good worker there s no vice in him he is still with you i presume yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean that s all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red headed man why that i asks why says he here s another vacancy on the league of the red headed men it s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour here s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stay at home man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door mat in that way i didn t know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the league of the red headed men he asked with his eyes open never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies and what are they worth i asked oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with one s other occupations well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy tell me all about it said i well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself red headed and he had a great sympathy for all red headed men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do but said i there would be millions of red headed men who would apply not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with red headed folk and pope s court looked like a coster s orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they were straw lemon orange brick irish setter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flame coloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobbler s wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family i answered that i had not his face fell immediately dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you what would be the hours i asked ten to two now a pawnbroker s business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before pay day so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up that would suit me very well said i and the pay is 4 a week and the work is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you don t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time it s only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet and the work is to copy out the encyclop dia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blotting paper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready to morrow certainly i answered then good bye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclop dia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quill pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for pope s court well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two o clock he bade me good day complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week s work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b s before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end to an end yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten o clock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note paper it read in this fashion the red headed league is dissolved october 9 1890 sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldn t miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red headed league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him well said i the gentleman at no 4 what the red headed man yes oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday where could i find him oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 17 king edward street near st paul s i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee caps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes i went home to saxe coburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some 30 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement how long had he been with you about a month then how did he come in answer to an advertisement was he the only applicant no i had a dozen why did you pick him because he was handy and would come cheap at half wages in fact yes what is he like this vincent spaulding small stout built very quick in his ways no hair on his face though he s not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you oh yes sir i have only just left him and has your business been attended to in your absence nothing to complain of sir there s never very much to do of a morning that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two to day is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter what are you going to do then i asked to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you won t speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk like nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece sarasate plays at the st james s hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours i have nothing to do to day my practice is never very absorbing then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxe coburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabby genteel place where four lines of dingy two storied brick houses looked out into a small railed in enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke laden and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our red headed client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbroker s and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a bright looking clean shaven young fellow who asked him to step in thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before evidently said i mr wilson s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red headed league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him not him what then the knees of his trousers and what did you see what i expected to see why did you beat the pavement my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemy s country we know something of saxe coburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimer s the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlane s carriage building depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor we ve done our work so it s time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violin land where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth hound holmes the relentless keen witted ready handed criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black letter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st james s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged yes it would be as well and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious why serious a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but to day being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help to night at what time ten will be early enough i shall be at baker street at ten very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the red headed copier of the encyclop dia down to the visit to saxe coburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smooth faced pawnbroker s assistant was a formidable man a man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation it was a quarter past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sad faced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock coat ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his pea jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in to night s adventure we re hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he won t mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for seven and twenty years that i have not had my rubber i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake to night than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some 30 000 and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger he s a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london he s a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself he ll crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next i ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to night i ve had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas lit streets until we emerged into farrington street we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earth smelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30 000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2 000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carr e you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemy s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moment s notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxe coburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier in breath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a clean cut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulder high and waist high until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair it s all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and i ll swing for it sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the man s wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor it s no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coat tails there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you and i you holmes answered your red headed idea was very new and effective you ll see your pal again presently said jones he s quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red headed league you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclop dia must be to get this not over bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clay s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice s hair the 4 a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation but how could you guess what the motive was had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the man s business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistant s fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellar something which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend s premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to night i asked well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilson s presence in other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come to night you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so and you are a benefactor of the race said i he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked l homme c est rien l uvre c est tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand iii a case of identity my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the cross purposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outr results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but here i picked up the morning paper from the ground let us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husband s cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral tinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broad brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de c ur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full sailed merchant man behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad good humoured face you ve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me i m not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his finger tips together and his eyes to the ceiling again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibank that is my father took it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself and your mother is alive oh yes mother is alive and well i wasn t best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after father s death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got 4700 for the goodwill and interest which wasn t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention your own little income he asked does it come out of the business oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying 4 per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i don t wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel a flush stole over miss sutherland s face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday school treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all father s friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met him that is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more no well you know father didn t like anything of the sort he wouldn t have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know were you engaged to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmer mr angel was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street and what office that s the worst of it mr holmes i don t know where did he live then he slept on the premises and you don t know his address no except that it was leadenhall street where did you address your letters then to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldn t have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle he d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didn t quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didn t want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding it missed him then yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviour s near king s cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four wheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the four wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a wedding morning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened but you have no notion as to what it could have been none one more question how did your mother take the matter she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again and your father did you tell him yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me half mad to think of it and i can t sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life then you don t think i ll see him again i fear not then what has happened to him you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare i advertised for him in last saturday s chronicle said she here is the slip and here are four letters from him thank you and your address no 31 lyon place camberwell mr angel s address you never had i understand where is your father s place of business he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloud wreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in 77 and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumb nails or the great issues that may hang from a boot lace now what did you gather from that woman s appearance describe it well she had a slate coloured broad brimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didn t observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly well to do in a vulgar comfortable easy going way sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a woman s sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewing machine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pince nez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her it surprised me but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toe cap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots half buttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friend s incisive reasoning i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel i held the little printed slip to the light missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black side whiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frock coat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elastic sided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing c c that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you they are typewritten i remarked not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestive in fact we may call it conclusive of what my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young lady s stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six o clock to morrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six o clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the d nouement of the little mystery i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and test tubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him well have you solved it i asked as i entered yes it was the bisulphate of baryta no no the mystery i cried oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door this is the girl s stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in the man who entered was a sturdy middle sized fellow some thirty years of age clean shaven and sallow skinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair good evening mr james windibank said holmes i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six o clock yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am delighted to hear it he said it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man s handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the e s slurred and the r s tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap oh it won t do really it won t said holmes suavely there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question that s right sit down and let us talk it over our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow it it s not actionable he stammered i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warm hearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girl s short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carried away very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentleman s attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girl s affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man s face it is not part of my duties to my client but here s a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road there s a cold blooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction and how did you verify them having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise the whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ james windibank voil tout and miss sutherland if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world iv the boscombe valley mystery we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the 11 15 what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me will you go i really don t know what to say i have a fairly long list at present oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling cloak and close fitting cloth cap it is really very good of you to come watson said he it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of note taking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack have you heard anything of the case he asked not a word i have not seen a paper for some days the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult that sounds a little paradoxical but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man it is a murder then well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an ex australian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race meetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servants a man and a girl turner had a considerable household some half dozen at the least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families now for the facts on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been out with his serving man in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a game keeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the game keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the game keeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt end of his son s gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police court i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middle aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so self evident a thing as that how on earth my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my m tier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering what are they it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner s jury it was a confession i ejaculated no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the self reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged what is the young man s own account of the matter it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the game keeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than 150 yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turner s lodge keeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat the coroner what did you understand by that witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel witness i should prefer not to answer the coroner i am afraid that i must press it witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise witness i must still refuse the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father witness it was the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol witness with considerable confusion i do not know a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured witness nothing definite the coroner what do you mean witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help yes it was gone you cannot say what it was no i had a feeling something was there how far from the body a dozen yards or so and how far from the edge of the wood about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it yes but with my back towards it this concluded the examination of the witness i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his father s dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young man s favour don t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes it was nearly four o clock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little country town of ross a lean ferret like man furtive and sly looking was waiting for us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it is entirely a question of barometric pressure lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said how is the glass twenty nine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to night lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one can t refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a woman s quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didn t do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tender hearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes you may rely upon my doing all that i can but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent i think that it is very probable there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it in what way asked holmes it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet and and well he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a union no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her thank you for this information said he may i see your father if i call to morrow i am afraid the doctor won t allow it the doctor yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria ha in victoria that is important yes at the mines quite so at the gold mines where as i understand mr turner made his money yes certainly thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me you will tell me if you have any news to morrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent i will miss turner i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him good bye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint i am not over tender of heart but i call it cruel i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in prison yes but only for you and me '"
